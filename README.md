Customer Complaint Handling (QM Notification – SAP QM)

This project provides a complete, end-to-end explanation of how Customer Complaints are handled in SAP Quality Management (QM) using QM Notification Type Q1.


1. Project Overview

        Customer complaint handling is a critical quality process where defects reported by customers are analyzed, documented, and resolved using corrective & preventive actions (CAPA).
        In SAP, this is executed using QM Notifications, specifically:
        
        Notification Type Q1 – Customer Complaint
        
              This project covers:
   
                  ✔ Complete business scenario
                  ✔ Step-by-step SAP execution
                  ✔ Test data for hands-on practice
                  ✔ Tasks, causes, defects & CAPA handling
                 

2. Business Scenario

        A customer ABC Industries (Customer: CUST1001) reports a defect in the delivered product FP1001 – Finished Product.

        The complaint description:
        
            “The received product has dents and scratches.”
            
            The Quality Management team registers a Customer Complaint Notification (Q1) and processes it through defect recording, root cause analysis, and corrective actions.
